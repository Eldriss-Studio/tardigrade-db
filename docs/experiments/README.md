# Experiments

Empirical tests validating TardigradeDB's core thesis: that persistent memory in latent space — using raw KV cache tensors, not text or embeddings — enables a fundamentally different kind of LLM memory.

## Completed Experiments

### [Two-Agent Memory Cycle](two-agent-memory-test.md)

**Date:** April 22, 2026  
**Status:** Complete

Two independent Claude Sonnet agents — one generating experiential memories, one retrieving them blind — communicate exclusively through TardigradeDB. Tests both a word-hash baseline and real GPT-2 KV cache tensors.

**Key findings:**
- 92% recall with word-hash vectors (weakest possible baseline)
- 80% recall with GPT-2 KV cache tensors, but with 100x stronger signal-to-noise separation
- ~1,600-point score gap between genuine memories and noise makes confidence thresholding practical
- Missed memories are model-quality limitations (GPT-2, 117M params), not architectural ones
- One missed memory (a peripheral observation about a coworker's keyboard) accidentally modeled realistic human memory decay

**Scripts:** `examples/sonnet_memory_test.py` (word-hash), `examples/kv_memory_test.py` (KV cache)

### [KV Injection Critique & Validation](kv-injection-critique.md)

**Date:** April 22, 2026  
**Status:** Complete — validated empirically

External critique questioning whether cross-context KV injection works. [Validation test](kv-injection-results.md) proved:
- **Full per-token KV injection works** — 26x to 829x improvement over baseline, matching or exceeding Text RAG
- **Mean-pooled injection is broken** — mathematical category error (hidden states ≠ K/V projection space)
- **Q4 quantization preserves 89% of injection quality** — TardigradeDB's storage approach is viable
- **The reviewer was wrong about KV portability, right about mean-pooling concerns**

## Planned Experiments

| Experiment | Goal | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **[KV injection validation](kv-injection-validation-test.md)** | **Test if cross-context KV injection helps, hurts, or is neutral** | **Next up** |
| Larger model test (7B+) | Validate that richer representations improve recall | Planned |
| Multi-session memory | Cross-day retrieval ("what happened last week") | Planned |
| Governance decay | Verify unused memories demote over simulated time | Planned |
| Adversarial retrieval | Contradictory memories, test which surfaces | Planned |
| Confidence thresholding | Calibrate "I don't remember" cutoff | Planned |
| Cross-model retrieval | Store from one model, retrieve with another | Planned |
